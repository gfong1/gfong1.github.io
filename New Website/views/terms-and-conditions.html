	<h3>Account Information</h3>

	<p>

	  and to post any User Content (as defined below), You must create an account ("Account") with 

	  PLAYFULL by accessing the Service through Your Facebook account (Your "Facebook Login") 

	  or email account. When You register through Your Facebook Login, You will be asked to login

	  privacy settings in Your Facebook account to permit Your activities on the Service to be shared 

	  with Your contacts in Your Facebook account (as further detailed in our Privacy Policy). By

	  Facebook account information and You acknowledge and agree that Your use of the Facebook 

	  website is governed by the terms and conditions of Facebook's terms of use and its privacy 

	  policy, including, without limitation, Facebook's password and account security policies. By 

	  creating an Account with PLAYFULL, You agree to the following rules to protect the security of 

	  Your Account and Facebook Login. For the purposes of these Terms, references to Your 

	  Facebook Login shall include any account information, including user names, passwords or 

	  security questions, whether or not created for the purpose of using the Service, that are used to 

	  access the Service: (1) You shall not share Your Facebook Login, nor let anyone else access 

	  Your Facebook account or do anything else that might jeopardize the security of Your Facebook 

	  Login. PLAYFULL will not ask You to reveal Your Facebook password and will not initiate 

	  contact with You asking for answers to Your Facebook password security questions; (2) In the 

	  event You become aware of or reasonably suspect any breach of security, including, without 

	  limitation any loss, theft, or unauthorized use of Your Facebook Login, You will immediately 

	  notify PLAYFULL and modify Your Facebook Login; (3) You are solely responsible for 

	  maintaining the confidentiality of Your Facebook Login, and You will be responsible for all uses 

	  of Your Facebook Login, including purchases, whether or not authorized by You; (4) You are 

	  responsible for anything that happens on the Service through the use of Your Facebook Login, 

	  whether or not such actions were taken by You. You therefore acknowledge that PLAYFULL 

	  may suspend Your access to or terminate Your use of the Service if someone else uses it to 

	  engage in any activity that violates these Terms; (5) You are responsible for any use of Your 

	  credit card or other payment instrument by minors. Any personal information You provide to us, 

	  which may include Your name, birth date and email address, will be held and used in 

	  accordance with PLAYFULL's Privacy Policy. You agree that You will supply accurate and 

	  complete information to us, and that You will update that information promptly after it changes. 

	  From time to time, other Rewards Partners may institute programs that require You to link Your 

	  Account to an account sponsored by such Rewards Partner. If you choose to participate in such 

	  programs, You hereby agree to comply with all applicable Reward Partner rules, policies, and 

	  terms and conditions.
	</p>

	<h3>License</h3>

	<p>
	  To use the Service You must have a mobile device that is compatible with the Application. 

	  PLAYFULL does not warrant that the Application will be compatible with your mobile device. If 

	  you decide to use the Service, subject to Your agreement and compliance with these Terms, the 

	  Privacy Policy, and applicable terms and conditions of the rewards programs offered by our 

	  other Rewards Partners, PLAYFULL hereby grants You a non-exclusive, non-transferable, 

	  revocable license to install and use an object code copy of the Application for one registered 

	  account on one mobile device owned or leased solely by You. PLAYFULL also grants You a 

	  personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable, limited scope license 

	  to access and use those portions of the Service that are not part of the Application. Use of the 

	  Service shall be solely for Your own, private, non-commercial entertainment purposes and for no 

	  other purpose whatsoever. If the Service or any part thereof is determined to be illegal under the 

	  laws of the jurisdiction in which You are situated, You shall not be granted any license to use the 

	  Application or any other part of the Service, and must refrain from using it. You may not: (i) 

	  modify, disassemble, decompile or reverse engineer the Application; (ii) rent, lease, loan, resell, 

	  sublicense, distribute or otherwise transfer the Application to any third party or use the 

	  Application to provide time sharing or similar services for any third party; (iii) make any copies of 

	  the Application; (iv) remove, circumvent, disable, damage or otherwise interfere with security-
	  related features of the Application, features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any content 

	  accessible through the App, or features that enforce limitations on use of the Application; or (v) 

	  delete the copyright and other proprietary rights notices on the Application. You acknowledge 

	  that PLAYFULL may from time to time issue upgraded versions of the Application, and may 

	  automatically electronically upgrade the version of the Application that You are using on Your 

	  mobile device, but that PLAYFULL has no obligation to do so. You consent to such automatic 

	  upgrading on Your mobile device, and agree that the terms and conditions of these Terms will 

	  apply to all such upgrades. The foregoing license grant is not a sale of the Application or any 

	  copy thereof, and PLAYFULL and its third party licensors or suppliers retain all right, title, and 

	  interest in and to the Application (and any copy of the Application). Standard carrier data 

	  charges may apply to Your use of the Application.
	</p>

	<h3>Virtual Items</h3>

	<p>
	  From time to time during Your use of the Service, You may have the opportunity to "earn", "buy" 

	  or "purchase" (a) virtual in-game items; or (b) virtual in-game points, including but not limited to 

	  virtual coins, cash or points, all for use in the Service (together with virtual in-game items, 

	  "Virtual Items"). You do not in fact "own" the Virtual Items and the amounts of any Virtual Item 

	  do not refer to any credit balance of real points or its equivalent. Rather, by "earning", "buying", 

	  or "purchasing" Virtual Items (through the use of virtual points), You are granted a limited license 

	  to use the software programs that manifest themselves as the Virtual Items. The purchase and 

	  sale of such limited licenses to use Virtual Items, is a completed transaction upon redemption of 

	  the applicable Credits and shall under no circumstances be refundable, transferable or 

	  exchangeable including, without limitation, upon termination of Your Account, termination of 

	  these Terms, and/or the discontinuation of the Service. PLAYFULL prohibits and does not 

	  recognize any purported transfers of Virtual Items effectuated outside of the Service, or the 

	  purported sale, gift or trade of anything that appears or originates in the Service, unless 

	  otherwise expressly authorized by PLAYFULL in writing. Accordingly, You may not sublicense, 

	  trade, sell or attempt to sell in-game Virtual Items for real money, or exchange Virtual Items for 

	  value of any kind outside of a game, without PLAYFULL' written permission. Any such transfer 

	  or attempted transfer is prohibited and void, and will subject Your Account to termination. You 

	  acknowledge and agree: (a) that PLAYFULL may change the price of Virtual Items at any time, 

	  without notice, for any reason or for no reason, (b) that the amount of virtual points necessary to 

	  obtain certain Virtual Items may fluctuate, and (c) that PLAYFULL has no liability to You for any 

	  changes in the price of such Virtual Items and/or the amount of virtual points necessary to 

	  obtain Virtual Items. PLAYFULL reserves the right, without prior notification, to limit the quantity 

	  of the Virtual Items You can purchase and/or to refuse to allow You to purchase such Virtual 

	  Items. You acknowledge and agree that PLAYFULL shall have no liability for loss of Virtual 

	  Items due to any unauthorized third party activity, such as hacking, phishing, password mining, 

	  social engineering, and/or any other unauthorized third party activity. PLAYFULL may replace 

	  such lost Virtual Items at its sole discretion on a case-by-case basis, without incurring any 

	  further obligation or liability.PLAYFULL owns, has licensed, or otherwise has rights to use all of 

	  the content that appears on or in the Service, including all such content owned by our Rewards 

	  Partners and their affiliates. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary herein, You agree that 

	  You have no right or title in or to any content that appears in the Service, including without 

	  limitation the Virtual Items therein, whether "earned" in a game or "purchased" from PLAYFULL.
	</p>

	<h3>Experience Points</h3>

	<p>
	  You will have the opportunity to accumulate "Experience Points" through Your use of the 

	  Service. Experience Points are virtual in-game points that You can use to "purchase" other 

	  Virtual Items within the Service. As with all Virtual Items, You do not in fact own the Experience 

	  Points You accumulate and the amounts of any Experience Points You accumulate do not refer 

	  to any credit balance of real currency or its equivalent. Rather, by "earning", "buying", or 

	  "purchasing" Experience Points, You are merely granted a limited license to use the software 

	  programs that manifest themselves as the Experience Points. In the event PLAYFULL 

	  encounters issues with the game that impact the accumulation of Experience Points and/or the 

	  redemption of Rewards, PLAYFULL reserves the right to correct any such errors. If You 

	  participate in any of our Rewards Partners’ rewards programs, the Experience Points You 

	  accumulate through Your use of the Service may be exchanged for items, services or 

	  experiences (each a "Reward") offered by such Rewards Partners through those programs.
	</p>

	<h3>Accumulating Experience Points</h3>

	<p>
	  You may accumulate Experience Points by taking certain actions while using the Services. For 

	  example, You may earn Experience Points by posting Your in-game achievements to your 

	  Facebook account, "liking" certain aspects of the Service, playing the games for a specified 

	  duration, or participating in certain in-game offers. The foregoing list is solely for purposes of 

	  example and explanation and is not meant to be exclusive or exhaustive. Experience Points are 

	  NOT and WILL NOT be awarded or earned in any way related to or based upon the outcome of 

	  any game You play during Your use of the Services. NO PURCHASE IS NECESSARY to play 

	  any of the games included in the Service.
	</p>

	<h3>Using Experience Points</h3>

	<p>
	  You may exchange Your accumulated Experience Points for in-game Virtual Items in the 

	  Service. You may also exchange Your Experience Points for Rewards in the "Rewards" area of 

	  the Service. In order to redeem a Reward, you must have a valid Facebook account or email 

	  account and have connected the Application to your Facebook account or email account. Once 

	  You have exchanged Experience Points for a Reward, You are said to have "purchased" that 

	  Reward. After purchasing Your Reward, You will have until the expiration date and time shown 

	  on the Reward to "redeem" Your Reward. Because the Redemption Period, redemption 

	  procedures, and other terms of Rewards may vary, You must review the specific terms and 

	  conditions of each Reward You purchase with Your Experience Points. PLAYFULL is not 

	  responsible for the terms and conditions of the Rewards and bears no responsibility to You for 

	  any such unread, misread or misunderstood terms. The selection and availability of Rewards is 

	  subject to change without notice and PLAYFULL makes no guarantees as to the availability of 

	  any Reward. For complete details and the terms, conditions and restrictions for any individual 

	  reward, please refer to the rewards detail found within the Rewards list within the Service.
	</p>

	<h3>Reward Cancellations and Refunds</h3>

	<p>
	  Once You have redeemed a Reward, You may no longer cancel that Reward and You will not 

	  receive a refund of Your Experience Points. On rare occasions, a Reward will "sell out" or 

	  otherwise become unavailable between the time You purchase it and the time You redeem it. If 

	  You are, within the Redemption Period, unable to redeem a purchased Reward because of such 

	  unavailability, You will be eligible to receive a full refund of the Experience Points used to 

	  purchase that Reward. If You do not redeem or cancel a Reward during that Reward's 

	  Redemption Period, the Reward will expire. Your Experience Points will not be refunded to You 

	  if You allow a purchased Reward to expire. Some Rewards are of such limited availability that 

	  our Rewards Partners may, in their sole discretion, deem them to be non-refundable. Non-
	  
	  refundable Rewards do not have a Redemption Period and therefore may not be cancelled for a 

	  refund of Experience Points after they are purchased. You are solely responsible for reading 

	  and understanding the refund terms and conditions of each Reward You purchase.
	</p>

	<h3>Changes and Other Rewards Terms</h3>

	<p>
	  From time to time, other Rewards Partners may require You to enroll in separate rewards 

	  programs as a condition of redeeming certain Rewards. If you choose to participate in such 

	  programs, You hereby agree to comply with all applicable Reward Partner rules, policies, and 

	  terms and conditions. Once You have redeemed a Reward with any such Rewards Partner, 

	  Your ability to change that Reward may be at the sole discretion of that Rewards Partner. Any 

	  such changes will not result in a change to Your Experience Points balance.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Rewards have no cash value and are non-transferable. You may not sell, trade, barter, 

	  bequeath or in any way transfer any Reward to any other party. Any attempt to do so will 

	  invalidate the Reward and may result in the termination of Your Account.
	</p>

	<h3>Inactive Accounts</h3>

	<p>
	  If You do not use your Account by logging in using the Service at least once every 30 days, Your 

	  Account will be deemed inactive. You can, at any time, reactivate Your Account by logging in 

	  and using the Service. When an Account has been deemed inactive, PLAYFULL may, at its own 

	  discretion, expire any Experience Points accumulated by You. Once Your account is deemed 

	  inactive, any Rewards which have been purchased but not yet redeemed may also be expired 

	  at the discretion of PLAYFULL.
	</p>


	<h3>Third Party Providers of Goods and Services</h3>

	<p>
	  Our Rewards Partners reserve the right, in their sole discretion, to change, amend, suspend, 

	  cancel, or terminate any reward program they offer or any aspects and/or terms and conditions 

	  thereof, in whole or in part, at any time, with or without notice and for any or no reason. Any 

	  such changes may affect Your ability to use the Experience Points that You have accumulated 

	  through Your use of the Service to purchase or redeem Rewards from such Rewards Partners. 

	  You hereby agree that PLAYFULL shall have no liability to You as a result of such action any 

	  Rewards Partner.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Your purchase of Facebook Credits is governed by Facebook's Payments Terms (http://

	  www.facebook.com/payments_terms). Facebook reserves the right to change its Payment 

	  Terms, in whole or in part, even though the changes may affect Your accumulated Facebook 

	  Credits. Facebook may also suspend, remove or disable access to the Service at any time 

	  without notice and may limit the number of transactions or volume of Facebook Credits 

	  PLAYFULL is able to accept during a given period of time. Such actions may affect Your ability 

	  to access and/or use the Service. You here by agree that PLAYFULL shall have no liability to 

	  You as a result of any such actions by Facebook. Facebook is a registered trademark of 

	  Facebook, Inc.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Your correspondence or business dealings with, or participation in promotions sponsored by, 

	  any third party providers of goods or services made available on or through the Service, 

	  including Your purchase of Facebook Credits, Your participation the rewards programs offered 

	  by any of our Rewards Partners, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations 

	  associated with such dealings, are solely between You and such third-party provider and solely 

	  at Your own risk. You hereby release PLAYFULL (and its affiliates, officers, directors, agents, 

	  subsidiaries, and employees) from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and 

	  consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way 

	  connected with such dealings or as the result of the presence of such third-party providers on 

	  the Service. If You are a California resident, You waive California Civil Code §1542, which says: 

	  "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to 

	  exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must 

	  have materially affected his settlement with the debtor." If You are a resident of any other 

	  jurisdiction that requires a similar waiver for the foregoing release to be enforceable, You hereby 

	  waive any applicable statutes of that jurisdiction.
	</p>

	<h3>Termination</h3>

	<p>
	  PLAYFULL may terminate or suspend Your Account (including, but not limited to, suspending 

	  your ability to purchase, redeem or consume Rewards) and/or Your access to Service 

	  (including, but not limited to, restricting your ability to use the Application) at any time, including 

	  for breach of these Terms or otherwise, without notice and without liability to You. Upon any 

	  such termination, Your access to the Service, including all User Content (as defined below) and 

	  Virtual Items, will be disabled and You will lose any Experience Points that you have 

	  accumulated. PLAYFULL shall have the right, but not obligation, to store any User Content 

	  subsequent to any such termination. You may cancel Your Account at any time by discontinuing 

	  Your use of the Service and/or the Application and, if applicable, removing the PLAYFULL 

	  application from Your mobile device and Facebook Account. Please note that removing the 

	  PLAYFULL application from Your Facebook Account will delete Your account with PLAYFULL 

	  and all of the Virtual Items (including any Experience Points) that You have accumulated will be 

	  lost. PLAYFULL is in no way liable to You for the effects of any termination or cancellation on 

	  Your use of the Service or the Virtual Items You have accumulated.
	</p>

	<h3>User Content and Feedback</h3>

	<p>
	  The Service may include various forums, blogs, and chat rooms where You and other users can 

	  post Your observations and comments on designated topics ("User Content"). PLAYFULL 

	  cannot guarantee that other users will not use the ideas and information that You share. 

	  Therefore, if You have an idea or information that You would like to keep confidential do not post

	  otherwise exploit such User Content only on, through or by means of the Service. PLAYFULL 

	  does not claim any ownership rights in any such User Content and nothing in these Terms will 

	  be deemed to restrict any rights that You may have to use and exploit any such User Content. 

	  You acknowledge and agree that You are solely responsible for all User Content that You make 

	  available through the Service. Accordingly, You represent and warrant that: (i) You either are the 

	  sole and exclusive owner of all User Content that You make available through the Service or 

	  that You have all rights, licenses, consents and releases that are necessary to grant to 

	  PLAYFULL the rights in such User Content as contemplated under these Terms; and (ii) neither 

	  the User Content nor Your posting, uploading, publication, submission or transmittal of the User 

	  Content or PLAYFULL' use of the User Content (or any portion thereof) on, through or by means 

	  of the Service will infringe, misappropriate or violate a third party's patent, copyright, trademark, 

	  trade secret, moral rights or other proprietary or intellectual property rights, or rights of publicity 

	  or privacy, or result in the violation of any applicable law or regulation. PLAYFULL may or may 

	  not regulate User Content and provides no representations or guarantees regarding the

	  Content. PLAYFULL reserves the right (but shall at no time be obligated) to, in its sole 

	  discretion, remove, block, edit, move, disable or permanently delete User Content from the

	  considered offensive and shall at no time be obligated to effect such removal other than under 

	  applicable law. PLAYFULL welcomes and encourages Your feedback, comments and

	<h2>Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</h2>

	<h3>Purpose</h3>

	<p>
	  This Dispute Resolution and Arbitration provision (this "Provision") facilitates the prompt and 

	  efficient resolution of any disputes that may arise between you and PLAYFULL. Arbitration is a 

	  form of private dispute resolution in which persons with a dispute waive their rights to file a 

	  lawsuit, to proceed in court and to a jury trial, and instead submit their disputes to a neutral third 

	  person (or arbitrator) for a binding decision. You have the right to opt-out of this Provision (as 

	  explained below), which means you would retain your right to litigate your disputes in a court, 

	  either before a judge or jury. Please read this Provision carefully. It provides that all Disputes 

	  between you and PLAYFULL (as defined below, for this Provision) shall be resolved by binding 

	  arbitration. Arbitration replaces the right to go to court. In the absence of this arbitration 

	  agreement, you may otherwise have a right or opportunity to bring claims in court, before a 

	  judge or jury, and/or participate in or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including, 

	  but not limited to, class actions). Except as otherwise provided, entering into this agreement 

	  constitutes a waiver of your right to litigate claims and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or 

	  jury. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. 

	  The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a 

	  court (including attorneys' fees). For the purpose of this Provision, "PLAYFULL" means 

	  PLAYFULL and its parents, subsidiary, and affiliate companies, and each of their respective 

	  officers, directors, employees, and agents. The term "Dispute" means any dispute, claim, or 

	  controversy between you and PLAYFULL regarding any aspect of your relationship with 

	  PLAYFULL, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not 

	  limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), or any other legal or 

	  equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this Provision (with the 

	  exception of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below). "Dispute" is to be given 

	  the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced. YOU AND PLAYFULL EACH AGREE 

	  THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, 

	  WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE 

	  PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING 

	  ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PROVISION.
	</p>

	<h3>Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution</h3>

	<p>
	  For all Disputes, whether pursued in court or arbitration, you must first give PLAYFULL an 

	  opportunity to resolve the Dispute. You must commence this process by mailing written 

	  notification to PLAYFULL Legal Department, 3357 Oakhurst Ave, Apt 8, Los Angeles, California 

	  90034. That written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, (3) a written 

	  description of your Claim, and (4) a description of the specific relief you seek. If PLAYFULL does 

	  not resolve the Dispute within 45 days after it receives your written notification, you may pursue 

	  your Dispute in arbitration. You may pursue your Dispute in a court only under the 

	  circumstances described below.
	</p>

	<h3>Exclusions from Arbitration/Right to Opt Out</h3>

	<p>
	  Notwithstanding the above, you or PLAYFULL may choose to pursue a Dispute in court and not 

	  by arbitration if (a) the Dispute qualifies, it may be initiated in small claims court; or (b) YOU 

	  OPT-OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE 

	  THAT YOU FIRST CONSENT TO THIS AGREEMENT (the "Opt-Out Deadline"). You may opt 

	  out of this Provision by mailing written notification to PLAYFULL Legal Department, 3357 

	  Oakhurst Ave, Apt 8, Los Angeles, California 90034. Your written notification must include (1) 

	  your name, (2) your address, and (3) a clear statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes 

	  with PLAYFULL through arbitration. Your decision to opt-out of this Provision will have no 

	  adverse effect on your relationship with PLAYFULL. Any opt-out request received after the Opt-
	  Out Deadline will not be valid and you must pursue your Dispute in arbitration or small claims 

	  court.</p>

	<h3>Arbitration Procedures</h3>

	<p>If this Provision applies and the Dispute is not resolved as provided above ("Pre-Arbitration 

	  Claim Resolution") either you or PLAYFULL may initiate arbitration proceedings. The American 

	  Arbitration Association ("AAA"), www.adr.org, or JAMS, www.jamsadr.com, will arbitrate all 

	  Disputes, and the arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator. The arbitration shall be 

	  commenced as an individual arbitration, and shall in no event be commenced as a class 

	  arbitration. All issues shall be for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this Provision. 

	  For arbitration before AAA, for Disputes of less than $75,000, the AAA's Supplementary 

	  Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will apply; for Disputes involving $75,000 or more, 

	  the AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply. In either instance, the AAA's Optional Rules 

	  For Emergency Measures Of Protection shall apply. The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org 

	  or by calling 1-800-778-7879. For arbitration before JAMS, the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration 

	  Rules & Procedures and the JAMS Recommended Arbitration Discovery Protocols For 

	  Domestic, Commercial Cases will apply. The JAMS rules are available at www.jamsadr.com or 

	  by calling 1-800-352-5267. This Provision governs in the event it conflicts with the applicable 

	  arbitration rules. Under no circumstances will class action procedures or rules apply to the 

	  arbitration. Because the Service and these Terms concern interstate commerce, the Federal 

	  Arbitration Act ("FAA") governs the arbitrability of all Disputes. However, the arbitrator will apply 

	  applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or 

	  condition precedent to suit.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Arbitration Award—The arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be 

	  available pursuant to applicable law, and will not have the power to award relief to, against or for 

	  the benefit of any person who is not a party to the proceeding. The arbitrator will make any 

	  award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. Such 

	  award will be final and binding on the parties, except for any right of appeal provided by the 

	  FAA, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of 

	  enforcement.
	</p>

	<p>
	  <b>Location of Arbitration</b> - You or PLAYFULL may initiate arbitration in either Los Angeles, 

	  California or the federal judicial district that includes the address you provide in your written 

	  notification of Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution. In the event that you select the federal judicial 

	  district that includes the address you provide in your written notification of Pre-Arbitration Claim 

	  Resolution, PLAYFULL may transfer the arbitration to Los Angeles, California in the event that it 

	  agrees to pay any additional fees or costs you incur as a result of the transfer, as determined by 

	  the arbitrator.
	</p>

	<p>
	  <b>Payment of Arbitration Fees and Costs</b> - PLAYFULL will pay all arbitration filing fees and 

	  arbitrator's costs and expenses upon your written request given prior to the commencement of 

	  the arbitration. You are responsible for all additional fees and costs that you incur in the 

	  arbitration, including, but not limited to, attorneys or expert witnesses. Fees and costs may be 

	  awarded as provided pursuant to applicable law. In addition to any rights to recover fees and 

	  costs under applicable law, if you provide notice and negotiate in good faith with PLAYFULL as 

	  provided in the section above titled "Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution" and the arbitrator 

	  concludes that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to recover 

	  reasonable attorney's fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator.
	</p>

	<h3>Class Action Waiver</h3>

	<p>
	  Except as otherwise provided in this Provision, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one 

	  person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative 

	  proceeding or claims (such as a class action, consolidated action or private attorney general 

	  action) unless both you and PLAYFULL specifically agree to do so following initiation of the 

	  arbitration. If you choose to pursue your Dispute in court by opting out of this Provision, as 

	  specified above, this Class Action Waiver will not apply to you. Neither you, nor any other user 

	  of the Service can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, 

	  consolidated, or representative proceeding without having complied with the opt-out 

	  requirements above.
	</p>

	<h3>Jury Waiver</h3>

	<p>
	  You understand and agree that by entering into this agreement you and PLAYFULL are each 

	  waiving the right to a jury trial or a trial before a judge in a public court. In the absence of this 

	  Provision, you and PLAYFULL might otherwise have had a right or opportunity to bring Disputes 

	  in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate or be represented in a case filed in court 

	  by others (including class actions). Except as otherwise provided below, those rights are 

	  waived. Other rights that you would have if you went to court, such as the right to appeal and to 

	  certain types of discovery, may be more limited or may also be waived.
	</p>

	<h3>Severability</h3>

	<p>
	  If any clause within this Provision (other than the Class Action Waiver clause above) is found to 

	  be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Provision, and the remainder of 

	  this Provision will be given full force and effect. If the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be 

	  illegal or unenforceable, this entire Provision will be unenforceable and the Dispute will be 

	  decided by a court.
	</p>

	<h3>Continuation</h3>

	<p>
	  This Provision shall survive the termination of your service with PLAYFULL.
	</p>
