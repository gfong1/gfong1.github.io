            information about you from your use of our Services through these technologies: your unique device
            identifier (as permitted), device name and model; app pages you view; links you click; your IP address; your

            Applications, and/or use our Services.</p>
        <p>We may use this information in the aggregate or we may combine it with personal information about you.</p>
        <p>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your phone through its web browser for
            record-keeping purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Applications, while
            other cookies are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities at our Site
            and Applications. There are two types of cookies: session-based and persistent-based cookies.</p>

        <p><b>Session Cookies.</b> Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your
            computer when you close your browser or turn off your computer. We use session cookies to allow our systems
            to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged into the Site. This allows us to process
            your online transactions and requests and verify your identity, after you have logged in, as you move
            through our Site.</p>
        <p><b>Persistent Cookies.</b> Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or
            turned off your computer. We use persistent cookies to track aggregate and statistical information about
            user activity, which may be combined with other user information.Third Party Cookies. We may also engage
            third parties to track and analyze non-personally and personally identifiable Site data. We use the data
            collected by such third parties to help us administer and improve the quality of the Site and to analyze
            Site usage. Such third parties may combine the information that we provide about you with other information
            that they have collected. This Policy does not cover such third parties’ use of the data.</p>
        <p><b>Disabling Cookies.</b> Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit
            your browser options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell
            you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you
            receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our Site who disable cookies will be
            able to browse the Site, but some features may not function.</p>
        <p><b>Local Storage Objects.</b> We may use Flash Local Storage Objects ("Flash LSOs") to store your Site
            preferences and to personalize your visit. Flash LSOs are different from browser cookies because of the
            amount and type of data stored. You cannot control, delete, or disable the acceptance of Flash LSOs through
            your browser. For more information on Flash LSOs, or to learn how to manage your settings for Flash cookies,
            go to the Adobe Flash Player Help Page, choose "Global Storage Settings Panel" and follow the instructions.
            To see the Flash LSOs currently on your computer, choose "Website Storage Settings Panel" and follow the
            instructions to review and, if you choose, to delete any specific Flash LSO.</p>
        <p><b>Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies.</b> Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier,
            similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive,
            clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel
            tags), in connection with our Site to, among other things, track the activities of Site visitors, help us
            manage content, and compile statistics about Site usage. We and our third party service providers also use
            clear GIFs in HTML e-mails to our customers, to help us track e-mail response rates, identify when our
            e-mails are viewed, and track whether our e-mails are forwarded.</p>

            Site as well as other websites. This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements by
            displaying ads for products and services in which you might be interested. Third-party ad network providers,
            advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons

            www.aboutads.info/choices (DAA).Opting out of one or more NAI member or DAA member networks (many of which
            will be the same) only means that those members no longer will deliver targeted content or ads to you. It
            does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content or ads on our Site or other websites. You may
            continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing. Also,
            if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently
            erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, your NAI or DAA opt-out may no longer
            be effective. Additional information is available on NAI’s and DAA’s websites accessible by the above
