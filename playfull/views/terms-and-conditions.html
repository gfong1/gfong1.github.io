            THESE TERMS OF SERVICE ("TERMS") ARE A LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU

            ("YOU" OR "YOUR") AND PLAYFULL. BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING THE PLAYFULL

            APPLICATION (THE "APPLICATION") AND USING IT IN CONNECTION WITH OTHER

            SERVICES PROVIDED BY PLAYFULL OR OTHERWISE ACCESSED THROUGH THE USE

            OF THE APPLICATION (SUCH SERVICES AND THE APPLICATION COLLECTIVELY, THE

            "SERVICE") YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD, ACCEPT AND AGREE

            TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, DO NOT

            ACCESS OR OTHERWISE USE THE SERVICE.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b> These Terms contain a Dispute Resolution And Arbitration Provision,

            including Class Action Waiver that affects your rights under these Terms and with respect to

            disputes you may have with PLAYFULL. You may opt out of the binding individual arbitration

            and class action waiver as provided below. PLAYFULL reserves the right, in its sole discretion,

            to modify or change these Terms at any time by posting the changes on or within the Application

            or other parts of the Service. Your continued use of the Service following the posting of such

            changes constitutes Your acceptance of the revised Terms. PLAYFULL may use reasonable

            commercial efforts to provide notice of material changes to You. If the modified Terms are not

            acceptable to You, Your only recourse is to discontinue Your use of the Service. You agree that

            PLAYFULL may change any part of the Service, including its content, at any time or discontinue

            the Service or any part thereof, for any reason, without notice to You and without liability.

        <h3>Facebook&reg; Disclaimer</h3>

        <p>
            You agree and acknowledge, as condition of participating in the Service, that Facebook&reg;

            ("Facebook") does not sponsor, endorse, administer, and is in no way associated with, the

            Service. All questions regarding the Service must be directed to PLAYFULL, not Facebook. You

            also agree that as a condition of participating in the Service you shall release Facebook&reg; from

            any and all liability arising out of your participation in said Service.
        </p>

        <h3>Privacy</h3>

        <p>
            PLAYFULL will only use any personal information that You provide in connection with Your use

            of the Service in accordance with the terms of our privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") available

            within the Application. By accessing or using the Service, You consent to the collection, use and

            storage of Your information as outlined in the Privacy Policy. Questions regarding privacy issues

            should be directed to our customer service by email at support@beplayfull.com.
        </p>

        <h3>Eligibility</h3>

        <p>
            To use the Service, You must be a natural person who is assigned to the e-mail address or

            Facebook Login (as defined below) associated with Your registration. At our sole discretion, we

            may require proof that You meet this condition in connection with Your use of the Service.

            Failure to comply with this condition will result in the closing of Your Account and the loss of all

        </p>

        <h3>Account Information</h3>

        <p>
            In order to access and use the rest of the Service (including, but not limited to accumulating,

            purchasing and redeeming Experience Points, Virtual Items and Rewards (as defined below))

            and to post any User Content (as defined below), You must create an account ("Account") with

            PLAYFULL by accessing the Service through Your Facebook account (Your "Facebook Login")

            or email account. When You register through Your Facebook Login, You will be asked to login

            with Your Facebook log-in credentials ("Facebook Password") and, if applicable, configure Your

            privacy settings in Your Facebook account to permit Your activities on the Service to be shared

            with Your contacts in Your Facebook account (as further detailed in our Privacy Policy). By

            creating an Account via Your Facebook Login, You are allowing PLAYFULL to access Your

            Facebook account information and You acknowledge and agree that Your use of the Facebook

            website is governed by the terms and conditions of Facebook's terms of use and its privacy

            policy, including, without limitation, Facebook's password and account security policies. By

            creating an Account with PLAYFULL, You agree to the following rules to protect the security of

            Your Account and Facebook Login. For the purposes of these Terms, references to Your

            Facebook Login shall include any account information, including user names, passwords or

            security questions, whether or not created for the purpose of using the Service, that are used to

            access the Service: (1) You shall not share Your Facebook Login, nor let anyone else access

            Your Facebook account or do anything else that might jeopardize the security of Your Facebook

            Login. PLAYFULL will not ask You to reveal Your Facebook password and will not initiate

            contact with You asking for answers to Your Facebook password security questions; (2) In the

            event You become aware of or reasonably suspect any breach of security, including, without

            limitation any loss, theft, or unauthorized use of Your Facebook Login, You will immediately

            notify PLAYFULL and modify Your Facebook Login; (3) You are solely responsible for

            maintaining the confidentiality of Your Facebook Login, and You will be responsible for all uses

            of Your Facebook Login, including purchases, whether or not authorized by You; (4) You are

            responsible for anything that happens on the Service through the use of Your Facebook Login,

            whether or not such actions were taken by You. You therefore acknowledge that PLAYFULL

            may suspend Your access to or terminate Your use of the Service if someone else uses it to

            engage in any activity that violates these Terms; (5) You are responsible for any use of Your

            credit card or other payment instrument by minors. Any personal information You provide to us,

            which may include Your name, birth date and email address, will be held and used in

            accordance with PLAYFULL's Privacy Policy. You agree that You will supply accurate and

            complete information to us, and that You will update that information promptly after it changes.

            From time to time, other Rewards Partners may institute programs that require You to link Your

            Account to an account sponsored by such Rewards Partner. If you choose to participate in such

            programs, You hereby agree to comply with all applicable Reward Partner rules, policies, and

            terms and conditions.
        </p>

        <h3>License</h3>

        <p>
            To use the Service You must have a mobile device that is compatible with the Application.

            PLAYFULL does not warrant that the Application will be compatible with your mobile device. If

            you decide to use the Service, subject to Your agreement and compliance with these Terms, the

            Privacy Policy, and applicable terms and conditions of the rewards programs offered by our

            other Rewards Partners, PLAYFULL hereby grants You a non-exclusive, non-transferable,

            revocable license to install and use an object code copy of the Application for one registered

            account on one mobile device owned or leased solely by You. PLAYFULL also grants You a

            personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable, limited scope license

            to access and use those portions of the Service that are not part of the Application. Use of the

            Service shall be solely for Your own, private, non-commercial entertainment purposes and for no

            other purpose whatsoever. If the Service or any part thereof is determined to be illegal under the

            laws of the jurisdiction in which You are situated, You shall not be granted any license to use the

            Application or any other part of the Service, and must refrain from using it. You may not: (i)

            modify, disassemble, decompile or reverse engineer the Application; (ii) rent, lease, loan, resell,

            sublicense, distribute or otherwise transfer the Application to any third party or use the

            Application to provide time sharing or similar services for any third party; (iii) make any copies of

            the Application; (iv) remove, circumvent, disable, damage or otherwise interfere with security-
            related features of the Application, features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any content

            accessible through the App, or features that enforce limitations on use of the Application; or (v)

            delete the copyright and other proprietary rights notices on the Application. You acknowledge

            that PLAYFULL may from time to time issue upgraded versions of the Application, and may

            automatically electronically upgrade the version of the Application that You are using on Your

            mobile device, but that PLAYFULL has no obligation to do so. You consent to such automatic

            upgrading on Your mobile device, and agree that the terms and conditions of these Terms will

            apply to all such upgrades. The foregoing license grant is not a sale of the Application or any

            copy thereof, and PLAYFULL and its third party licensors or suppliers retain all right, title, and

            interest in and to the Application (and any copy of the Application). Standard carrier data

            charges may apply to Your use of the Application.
        </p>

        <h3>Virtual Items</h3>

        <p>
            From time to time during Your use of the Service, You may have the opportunity to "earn", "buy"

            or "purchase" (a) virtual in-game items; or (b) virtual in-game points, including but not limited to

            virtual coins, cash or points, all for use in the Service (together with virtual in-game items,

            "Virtual Items"). You do not in fact "own" the Virtual Items and the amounts of any Virtual Item

            do not refer to any credit balance of real points or its equivalent. Rather, by "earning", "buying",

            or "purchasing" Virtual Items (through the use of virtual points), You are granted a limited license

            to use the software programs that manifest themselves as the Virtual Items. The purchase and

            sale of such limited licenses to use Virtual Items, is a completed transaction upon redemption of

            the applicable Credits and shall under no circumstances be refundable, transferable or

            exchangeable including, without limitation, upon termination of Your Account, termination of

            these Terms, and/or the discontinuation of the Service. PLAYFULL prohibits and does not

            recognize any purported transfers of Virtual Items effectuated outside of the Service, or the

            purported sale, gift or trade of anything that appears or originates in the Service, unless

            otherwise expressly authorized by PLAYFULL in writing. Accordingly, You may not sublicense,

            trade, sell or attempt to sell in-game Virtual Items for real money, or exchange Virtual Items for

            value of any kind outside of a game, without PLAYFULL' written permission. Any such transfer

            or attempted transfer is prohibited and void, and will subject Your Account to termination. You

            acknowledge and agree: (a) that PLAYFULL may change the price of Virtual Items at any time,

            without notice, for any reason or for no reason, (b) that the amount of virtual points necessary to

            obtain certain Virtual Items may fluctuate, and (c) that PLAYFULL has no liability to You for any

            changes in the price of such Virtual Items and/or the amount of virtual points necessary to

            obtain Virtual Items. PLAYFULL reserves the right, without prior notification, to limit the quantity

            of the Virtual Items You can purchase and/or to refuse to allow You to purchase such Virtual

            Items. You acknowledge and agree that PLAYFULL shall have no liability for loss of Virtual

            Items due to any unauthorized third party activity, such as hacking, phishing, password mining,

            social engineering, and/or any other unauthorized third party activity. PLAYFULL may replace

            such lost Virtual Items at its sole discretion on a case-by-case basis, without incurring any

            further obligation or liability.PLAYFULL owns, has licensed, or otherwise has rights to use all of

            the content that appears on or in the Service, including all such content owned by our Rewards

            Partners and their affiliates. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary herein, You agree that

            You have no right or title in or to any content that appears in the Service, including without

            limitation the Virtual Items therein, whether "earned" in a game or "purchased" from PLAYFULL.
        </p>

        <h3>Experience Points</h3>

        <p>
            You will have the opportunity to accumulate "Experience Points" through Your use of the

            Service. Experience Points are virtual in-game points that You can use to "purchase" other

            Virtual Items within the Service. As with all Virtual Items, You do not in fact own the Experience

            Points You accumulate and the amounts of any Experience Points You accumulate do not refer

            to any credit balance of real currency or its equivalent. Rather, by "earning", "buying", or

            "purchasing" Experience Points, You are merely granted a limited license to use the software

            programs that manifest themselves as the Experience Points. In the event PLAYFULL

            encounters issues with the game that impact the accumulation of Experience Points and/or the

            redemption of Rewards, PLAYFULL reserves the right to correct any such errors. If You

            participate in any of our Rewards Partners’ rewards programs, the Experience Points You

            accumulate through Your use of the Service may be exchanged for items, services or

            experiences (each a "Reward") offered by such Rewards Partners through those programs.
        </p>

        <h3>Accumulating Experience Points</h3>

        <p>
            You may accumulate Experience Points by taking certain actions while using the Services. For

            example, You may earn Experience Points by posting Your in-game achievements to your

            Facebook account, "liking" certain aspects of the Service, playing the games for a specified

            duration, or participating in certain in-game offers. The foregoing list is solely for purposes of

            example and explanation and is not meant to be exclusive or exhaustive. Experience Points are

            NOT and WILL NOT be awarded or earned in any way related to or based upon the outcome of

            any game You play during Your use of the Services. NO PURCHASE IS NECESSARY to play

            any of the games included in the Service.
        </p>

        <h3>Using Experience Points</h3>

        <p>
            You may exchange Your accumulated Experience Points for in-game Virtual Items in the

            Service. You may also exchange Your Experience Points for Rewards in the "Rewards" area of

            the Service. In order to redeem a Reward, you must have a valid Facebook account or email

            account and have connected the Application to your Facebook account or email account. Once

            You have exchanged Experience Points for a Reward, You are said to have "purchased" that

            Reward. After purchasing Your Reward, You will have until the expiration date and time shown

            on the Reward to "redeem" Your Reward. Because the Redemption Period, redemption

            procedures, and other terms of Rewards may vary, You must review the specific terms and

            conditions of each Reward You purchase with Your Experience Points. PLAYFULL is not

            responsible for the terms and conditions of the Rewards and bears no responsibility to You for

            any such unread, misread or misunderstood terms. The selection and availability of Rewards is

            subject to change without notice and PLAYFULL makes no guarantees as to the availability of

            any Reward. For complete details and the terms, conditions and restrictions for any individual

            reward, please refer to the rewards detail found within the Rewards list within the Service.
        </p>

        <h3>Reward Cancellations and Refunds</h3>

        <p>
            Once You have redeemed a Reward, You may no longer cancel that Reward and You will not

            receive a refund of Your Experience Points. On rare occasions, a Reward will "sell out" or

            otherwise become unavailable between the time You purchase it and the time You redeem it. If

            You are, within the Redemption Period, unable to redeem a purchased Reward because of such

            unavailability, You will be eligible to receive a full refund of the Experience Points used to

            purchase that Reward. If You do not redeem or cancel a Reward during that Reward's

            Redemption Period, the Reward will expire. Your Experience Points will not be refunded to You

            if You allow a purchased Reward to expire. Some Rewards are of such limited availability that

            our Rewards Partners may, in their sole discretion, deem them to be non-refundable. Non-

            refundable Rewards do not have a Redemption Period and therefore may not be cancelled for a

            refund of Experience Points after they are purchased. You are solely responsible for reading

            and understanding the refund terms and conditions of each Reward You purchase.
        </p>

        <h3>Changes and Other Rewards Terms</h3>

        <p>
            From time to time, other Rewards Partners may require You to enroll in separate rewards

            programs as a condition of redeeming certain Rewards. If you choose to participate in such

            programs, You hereby agree to comply with all applicable Reward Partner rules, policies, and

            terms and conditions. Once You have redeemed a Reward with any such Rewards Partner,

            Your ability to change that Reward may be at the sole discretion of that Rewards Partner. Any

            such changes will not result in a change to Your Experience Points balance.
        </p>

        <p>
            Rewards have no cash value and are non-transferable. You may not sell, trade, barter,

            bequeath or in any way transfer any Reward to any other party. Any attempt to do so will

            invalidate the Reward and may result in the termination of Your Account.
        </p>

        <h3>Inactive Accounts</h3>

        <p>
            If You do not use your Account by logging in using the Service at least once every 30 days, Your

            Account will be deemed inactive. You can, at any time, reactivate Your Account by logging in

            and using the Service. When an Account has been deemed inactive, PLAYFULL may, at its own

            discretion, expire any Experience Points accumulated by You. Once Your account is deemed

            inactive, any Rewards which have been purchased but not yet redeemed may also be expired

            at the discretion of PLAYFULL.
        </p>


        <h3>Third Party Providers of Goods and Services</h3>

        <p>
            Our Rewards Partners reserve the right, in their sole discretion, to change, amend, suspend,

            cancel, or terminate any reward program they offer or any aspects and/or terms and conditions

            thereof, in whole or in part, at any time, with or without notice and for any or no reason. Any

            such changes may affect Your ability to use the Experience Points that You have accumulated

            through Your use of the Service to purchase or redeem Rewards from such Rewards Partners.

            You hereby agree that PLAYFULL shall have no liability to You as a result of such action any

            Rewards Partner.
        </p>

        <p>
            Your purchase of Facebook Credits is governed by Facebook's Payments Terms (http://

            www.facebook.com/payments_terms). Facebook reserves the right to change its Payment

            Terms, in whole or in part, even though the changes may affect Your accumulated Facebook

            Credits. Facebook may also suspend, remove or disable access to the Service at any time

            without notice and may limit the number of transactions or volume of Facebook Credits

            PLAYFULL is able to accept during a given period of time. Such actions may affect Your ability

            to access and/or use the Service. You here by agree that PLAYFULL shall have no liability to

            You as a result of any such actions by Facebook. Facebook is a registered trademark of

            Facebook, Inc.
        </p>

        <p>
            Your correspondence or business dealings with, or participation in promotions sponsored by,

            any third party providers of goods or services made available on or through the Service,

            including Your purchase of Facebook Credits, Your participation the rewards programs offered

            by any of our Rewards Partners, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations

            associated with such dealings, are solely between You and such third-party provider and solely

            at Your own risk. You hereby release PLAYFULL (and its affiliates, officers, directors, agents,

            subsidiaries, and employees) from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and

            consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way

            connected with such dealings or as the result of the presence of such third-party providers on

            the Service. If You are a California resident, You waive California Civil Code §1542, which says:

            "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to

            exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must

            have materially affected his settlement with the debtor." If You are a resident of any other

            jurisdiction that requires a similar waiver for the foregoing release to be enforceable, You hereby

        <h3>Termination</h3>

        <p>
            PLAYFULL may terminate or suspend Your Account (including, but not limited to, suspending

            your ability to purchase, redeem or consume Rewards) and/or Your access to Service

            (including, but not limited to, restricting your ability to use the Application) at any time, including

            for breach of these Terms or otherwise, without notice and without liability to You. Upon any

            and all of the Virtual Items (including any Experience Points) that You have accumulated will be

            lost. PLAYFULL is in no way liable to You for the effects of any termination or cancellation on

            Your use of the Service or the Virtual Items You have accumulated.

        <h2>Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</h2>

        <h3>Purpose</h3>

        <p>
            This Dispute Resolution and Arbitration provision (this "Provision") facilitates the prompt and

            efficient resolution of any disputes that may arise between you and PLAYFULL. Arbitration is a

            form of private dispute resolution in which persons with a dispute waive their rights to file a

            lawsuit, to proceed in court and to a jury trial, and instead submit their disputes to a neutral third

            person (or arbitrator) for a binding decision. You have the right to opt-out of this Provision (as

            explained below), which means you would retain your right to litigate your disputes in a court,

            either before a judge or jury. Please read this Provision carefully. It provides that all Disputes

            between you and PLAYFULL (as defined below, for this Provision) shall be resolved by binding

            arbitration. Arbitration replaces the right to go to court. In the absence of this arbitration

            agreement, you may otherwise have a right or opportunity to bring claims in court, before a

            judge or jury, and/or participate in or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including,

            but not limited to, class actions). Except as otherwise provided, entering into this agreement

            constitutes a waiver of your right to litigate claims and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or

            jury. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.

            The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a

            court (including attorneys' fees). For the purpose of this Provision, "PLAYFULL" means

            PLAYFULL and its parents, subsidiary, and affiliate companies, and each of their respective

            officers, directors, employees, and agents. The term "Dispute" means any dispute, claim, or

            controversy between you and PLAYFULL regarding any aspect of your relationship with

            PLAYFULL, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not

            limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), or any other legal or

            equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this Provision (with the

            exception of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below). "Dispute" is to be given

            the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced. YOU AND PLAYFULL EACH AGREE

            THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE,

            WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE

            PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING

            ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PROVISION.
        </p>

        <h3>Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution</h3>

        <p>
            For all Disputes, whether pursued in court or arbitration, you must first give PLAYFULL an

            opportunity to resolve the Dispute. You must commence this process by mailing written

            notification to PLAYFULL Legal Department, 3357 Oakhurst Ave, Apt 8, Los Angeles, California

            90034. That written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, (3) a written

            description of your Claim, and (4) a description of the specific relief you seek. If PLAYFULL does

            not resolve the Dispute within 45 days after it receives your written notification, you may pursue

            your Dispute in arbitration. You may pursue your Dispute in a court only under the

            circumstances described below.
        </p>

        <h3>Exclusions from Arbitration/Right to Opt Out</h3>

        <p>
            Notwithstanding the above, you or PLAYFULL may choose to pursue a Dispute in court and not

            by arbitration if (a) the Dispute qualifies, it may be initiated in small claims court; or (b) YOU

            OPT-OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE

            THAT YOU FIRST CONSENT TO THIS AGREEMENT (the "Opt-Out Deadline"). You may opt

            out of this Provision by mailing written notification to PLAYFULL Legal Department, 3357

            Oakhurst Ave, Apt 8, Los Angeles, California 90034. Your written notification must include (1)

            your name, (2) your address, and (3) a clear statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes

            with PLAYFULL through arbitration. Your decision to opt-out of this Provision will have no

            adverse effect on your relationship with PLAYFULL. Any opt-out request received after the Opt-
            Out Deadline will not be valid and you must pursue your Dispute in arbitration or small claims

            court.</p>

        <h3>Arbitration Procedures</h3>

        <p>If this Provision applies and the Dispute is not resolved as provided above ("Pre-Arbitration

            Claim Resolution") either you or PLAYFULL may initiate arbitration proceedings. The American

            Arbitration Association ("AAA"), www.adr.org, or JAMS, www.jamsadr.com, will arbitrate all

            Disputes, and the arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator. The arbitration shall be

            commenced as an individual arbitration, and shall in no event be commenced as a class

            arbitration. All issues shall be for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this Provision.

            For arbitration before AAA, for Disputes of less than $75,000, the AAA's Supplementary

            Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will apply; for Disputes involving $75,000 or more,

            the AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply. In either instance, the AAA's Optional Rules

            For Emergency Measures Of Protection shall apply. The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org

            or by calling 1-800-778-7879. For arbitration before JAMS, the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration

            Rules & Procedures and the JAMS Recommended Arbitration Discovery Protocols For

            Domestic, Commercial Cases will apply. The JAMS rules are available at www.jamsadr.com or

            by calling 1-800-352-5267. This Provision governs in the event it conflicts with the applicable

            arbitration rules. Under no circumstances will class action procedures or rules apply to the

            arbitration. Because the Service and these Terms concern interstate commerce, the Federal

            Arbitration Act ("FAA") governs the arbitrability of all Disputes. However, the arbitrator will apply

            applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or

            condition precedent to suit.
        </p>

        <p>
            Arbitration Award—The arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be

            available pursuant to applicable law, and will not have the power to award relief to, against or for

            the benefit of any person who is not a party to the proceeding. The arbitrator will make any

            award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. Such

            award will be final and binding on the parties, except for any right of appeal provided by the

            FAA, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of

            enforcement.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Location of Arbitration</b> - You or PLAYFULL may initiate arbitration in either Los Angeles,

            California or the federal judicial district that includes the address you provide in your written

            notification of Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution. In the event that you select the federal judicial

            district that includes the address you provide in your written notification of Pre-Arbitration Claim

            Resolution, PLAYFULL may transfer the arbitration to Los Angeles, California in the event that it

            agrees to pay any additional fees or costs you incur as a result of the transfer, as determined by

            the arbitrator.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Payment of Arbitration Fees and Costs</b> - PLAYFULL will pay all arbitration filing fees and

            arbitrator's costs and expenses upon your written request given prior to the commencement of

            the arbitration. You are responsible for all additional fees and costs that you incur in the

            arbitration, including, but not limited to, attorneys or expert witnesses. Fees and costs may be

            awarded as provided pursuant to applicable law. In addition to any rights to recover fees and

            costs under applicable law, if you provide notice and negotiate in good faith with PLAYFULL as

            provided in the section above titled "Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution" and the arbitrator

            concludes that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to recover

            reasonable attorney's fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator.
        </p>

        <h3>Class Action Waiver</h3>

        <p>
            Except as otherwise provided in this Provision, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one

            person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative

            proceeding or claims (such as a class action, consolidated action or private attorney general

            action) unless both you and PLAYFULL specifically agree to do so following initiation of the

            arbitration. If you choose to pursue your Dispute in court by opting out of this Provision, as

            specified above, this Class Action Waiver will not apply to you. Neither you, nor any other user

            of the Service can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class,

            consolidated, or representative proceeding without having complied with the opt-out

            requirements above.
        </p>

        <h3>Jury Waiver</h3>

        <p>
            You understand and agree that by entering into this agreement you and PLAYFULL are each

            waiving the right to a jury trial or a trial before a judge in a public court. In the absence of this

            Provision, you and PLAYFULL might otherwise have had a right or opportunity to bring Disputes

            in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate or be represented in a case filed in court

            by others (including class actions). Except as otherwise provided below, those rights are

            waived. Other rights that you would have if you went to court, such as the right to appeal and to

            certain types of discovery, may be more limited or may also be waived.
        </p>

        <h3>Severability</h3>

        <p>
            If any clause within this Provision (other than the Class Action Waiver clause above) is found to

            be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Provision, and the remainder of

            this Provision will be given full force and effect. If the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be

            illegal or unenforceable, this entire Provision will be unenforceable and the Dispute will be

            decided by a court.
        </p>

        <h3>Continuation</h3>

        <p>
            This Provision shall survive the termination of your service with PLAYFULL.

            Your use of the iOS App must comply with Usage Rules set forth in Apple’s then-current App

            Store Terms of Service.
        </p>

        <p>

            available thereon. You acknowledge that Apple has no obligation to provide maintenance and

            support services with respect to our iOS App. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable

            law, Apple will have no warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to our iOS App and any

            Terms, for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any third party intellectual

            property infringement claim related to our iOS App or your possession and use of our iOS App.

            You represent and warrant that (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S.

            restricted parties.

        </p>

        <p>
            You agree that Apple and Apple’s subsidiaries are third party beneficiaries to these Terms as

            You acknowledge that these Terms are between you and PLAYFULL only, and not with Google,

            Inc. ("Google").
        </p>

        <p>
            Your use of the Android App must comply with Google’s then-current Google Play Terms of

            Service.
        </p>

        <p>
